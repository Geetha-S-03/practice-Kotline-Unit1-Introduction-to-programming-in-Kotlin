/*7. Implement basic math operations
In this exercise, you write a program that performs basic math operations and prints the output.

Step 1
This main() function contains one compile error:


fun main() {
    val firstNumber = 10
    val secondNumber = 5
    
    println("$firstNumber + $secondNumber = $result")
}
Can you fix the error so that the program prints this output?

10 + 5 = 15*/


fun main() {
    val firstNumber = 10
    val secondNumber = 5
    val result=firstNumber+secondNumber
    println("$firstNumber + $secondNumber = $result")
}
